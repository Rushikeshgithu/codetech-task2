Task 2 Report
Report on Cloud-Based Application Monitoring Setup Using AWS Cloud
1. Introduction
This report outlines the setup of monitoring for a cloud-based application using AWS Cloud services. The primary objective was to configure alerts and dashboards to track critical application metrics and alarms.
2. Tasks Completed
1.	Configured AWS CloudWatch for Monitoring:
o	Set up CloudWatch Metrics to collect data on application performance, system health, and resource utilization.
o	Defined custom metrics for application-specific parameters.
2.	Implemented CloudWatch Alarms:
o	Created alarms to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as CPU usage, memory utilization, request latency, and error rates.
o	Configured notifications using Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) to send alerts via email/SMS when thresholds are breached.
3.	Developed a CloudWatch Dashboard:
o	Designed a centralized dashboard displaying real-time metrics, alarms, and logs for easy monitoring.
o	Included visualizations like line charts and graphs to analyze trends.
4.	Ensured Logging and Event Handling:
o	Configured CloudWatch Logs to capture application and system logs.
o	Set up event rules for automated responses to specific system changes.
3. Deliverables
•	Configured Alerts & Alarms: Real-time notifications for performance anomalies.
•	Monitoring Dashboard: Visual representation of key metrics and alarms.
4. Conclusion
The AWS monitoring setup successfully enhances visibility into the application's health, providing proactive alerting and detailed insights. This ensures timely responses to issues, improving system reliability and operational efficiency
